`datelife` is a software that gets all available information on time of divergence of a group of lineages, and uses this information to date a phylogenetic tree.
Its functionalities can be accessed via the [`datelife` R package](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife), or through [`datelife`'s website](http://datelife.opentreeoflife.org/query), which is [constructed as an R shiny application](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelifeweb) and is containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=dockerhomepage&utm_content=namer&utm_term=dockerhomepage&utm_budget=growth&gclid=CjwKCAjw7--KBhAMEiwAxfpkWMXM6XbTANoSspqojqsXX7dBeTm13Yc7lwzn8kz7iAWAT_m0fEo9MRoCq9MQAvD_BwE), i.e. "dockerized", as [explained here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/dockerizing-shiny-applications/). 

This repository hosts the instructions for  "dockerizing" `datelife`, which we whipped up by following diverse [valuable resources](#resources). The `datelife` Docker allows anyone to set up their own server for the `datelife` web app anywhere.
There are a few alternative ways to do this. For all of them you require [Docker Desktop installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## 1. Using a prebuilt DateLife Docker image

Ideally, the latest `datelife` Docker image automatically builds and uploads to [bomeara/datelife's Docker Hub (the Docker cloud)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bomeara/datelife/dockerfile) with pushes to [this repository (the GitHub phylotastic/datelifedocker repo)](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelifedocker). However, due to  changes on Docker's product subscriptions, automatic builds are not available for the moment (last updated on `r date`). `datelife v0.5.0` is the latest, locally built, manually uploaded Docker image, and is hosted at [lunasare/datelife's Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lunasare/datelife).

<!-- Look at this for list styling: https://gist.github.com/bertobox/3503850#gistcomment-1213320 -->

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li> 1.1. To download the prebuilt <code>datelife</code> Docker image from Docker Hub you need <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker desktop installed</a>. Then, from terminal use the <code>docker pull</code> command:
  </li><br>

```shell
    # docker pull bomeara/datelife
    docker pull lunasare/datelife:v0.5.0
```

  <li> 1.2. Now, you can start the image using <code>docker run</code>. You can do this in "bash mode" so you can look around (i.e., in the /srv dir for the shiny app):
  </li><br>

```shell
    # docker run -t -i -p 80:3838 bomeara/datelife sh -c '/bin/bash'
    docker run -t -i -p 80:3838 lunasare/datelife:v0.5.0 sh -c '/bin/bash'
```

Once you've finished looking around, just type `exit` and you will be logged out.

  <li> 1.3. To start the image just in serve mode, do:
  </li><br>

```shell
    # docker run -t -i -d -p 80:3838 bomeara/datelife
    docker run -t -i -d -p 80:3838 lunasare/datelife:v0.5.0
```

Go to http://localhost on any browser to checkout your Datelife website and shiny app running.

Argument `-d` is optional, it stands for `--detach`, allowing you to keep on using your terminal while the DateLife website is being served.

## 2. Building your own DateLife Docker image

This is the option for developers, and local debugging. If you tried setting up a prebuilt Docker image and it fails, you should try this.

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li> 2.1. Make sure you have <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker desktop installed</a>. Then, download the <a href="https://github.com/phylotastic/datelifedocker">datelifedocker repository</a> to your computer. One way is to type from the terminal:
  </li><br>

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/phylotastic/datelifedocker.git
```

  <li> 2.2. Change directories to your newly created datelifedocker directory using <code>cd your_path/datelifedocker</code>, and build the DateLife Docker image with:
  </li><br>

```shell
    docker build -t datelife:[optional tag] .
```

To build with _no cache_ (that is, rebuilding the image from scratch)
type `docker build -t datelife --no-cache .`

Note! Building with _no cache_ will take about **2hrs and 36 min** to run.

  <li> 2.3 Now you can start the DateLife server from your newly created Docker image with:
  </li><br>

```shell
    docker run -t -i -p 80:3838 datelife:[optional tag]
```

Go to http://localhost on any browser to checkout your Datelife shiny app running.

To stop serving, type `Ctrl + c` or `exit`

  <li> 2.4. To explore the contents of the DateLife Docker image on terminal, you can do:
  </li><br>

```shell
docker run -t -i datelife:[optional tag] sh -c '/bin/bash'
```

If you want to explore a particular container, first list them all with `docker container ls`, and identify the `container-name` of the one you are interested in.

Then restart your container and execute it with:

```shell
docker container restart <container-name>
docker exec -it <container-name> sh -c '/bin/bash'
```

For more tips see [how-do-i-get-into-a-docker-containers-shell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30172605/how-do-i-get-into-a-docker-containers-shell)
and [15-docker-commands-you-should-know](https://towardsdatascience.com/15-docker-commands-you-should-know-970ea5203421).

  <li> 2.5. After building and making changes, you can push (if you have permissions) the new <code>datelife</code> Docker image to Docker hub with:
  </li><br>

```shell
    docker tag datelife:[version number] lunasare/datelife:[version number]
    docker login
    docker push lunasare/datelife:[version number]
```

Note! If you make any important changes to the `dockerfile`, please bump its version and
document the changes on the section [Docker image DateLife](#docker-image-datelife-v050-about) of this README.

</ul>

<br><br>

## 3. Running multiple instances

You can run multiple shiny app instances with:

```shell
    docker-compose up -d --scale datelife=10 # for ten instances
```

<br><br>

## 4. Swarm

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li> 4.1. Go to node where swarm is being managed. You can change the number of workers in replicas in the <code>docker-compose-swarm.yml</code> file.
  </li><br>

```shell
    sudo docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose-swarm.yml datelife
```

  <li> 4.2. See how it's doing with
  </li><br>

```shell
    sudo docker stack services datelife
```

  <li> 4.3. And stop it with
  </li><br>

```shell
    sudo docker stack rm datelife
```

For domain, *, @, www all resolve to `datelife19.campus.utk.edu.` (yes, with a period after edu) using CNAME

</ul>
